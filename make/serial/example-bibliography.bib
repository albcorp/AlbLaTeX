%   - bibtex(1) will dispense with unneeded capitals, so follow the
%     conventions and capitalise:
%       + the first word of the title;
%       + the first word after a colon;
%       + the second elements of hyphenated terms, unless it modifies
%         the first element, or both constitute a single word; and
%       + all other words except articles, unstressed prepositions, and
%         conjunctions.
%     Words that must be capitalised should be enclosed in braces.
%
%   - 'bibtex-generate-autokey' discards un-capitalized names so that
%     canonical names depend upon canonical capitalisation.
%
%   - bibtex(1) parses author and editor names to determine the
%     surname.  However, it is more reliable if written in the form:
%         San Martino, Maria
%         von Mannheim, Richard
%         Shipman, III, Frank M.
%
%   - Each entry must contain the fields `author, `title`, and `year`,
%     where year refers to the date of the publication or conference.
