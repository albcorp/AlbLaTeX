--------------
LaTeX packages
--------------

The collection of LaTeX style files and classes comprise a small set of
document layouts for technical writing.  These are supplemented by
macros for formatting mathematics and computer algorithms.

`alb-corp.cls`
  Document layout documentation of the /albcorp/ LaTeX packages

  See ``alb-corp-layout.pdf`` for further information.

`alb-journal.cls`
  LaTeX book design for a research journal

  See ``alb-journal-layout.pdf`` for further information.

`alb-thesis.cls`
  LaTeX book design for a thesis

  See ``alb-thesis-layout.pdf`` for further information.

`alb-float-tools.sty`
  LaTeX style file for typesetting float material and captions

  Provides environments and commands for typesetting float material and
  captions.  These include: an environment to typeset float material
  across the page including the marginpar allocation; a list environment
  to flow subcaptioned items across the available width; and commands to
  select the caption style according to the page on which a float falls.
  See ``alb-float-tools.pdf`` for further information.

`alb-order-theory.sty`
  Provides a collection of macros to make set and order theoretic
  mathematical constructs more readable and consistent in their
  formatting.  See ``alb-order-theory.pdf`` for further
  information.

`alb-graph-theory.sty`
  Provides a collection of macros to make graph theoretic mathematical
  constructs more readable and consistent in their formatting.  The
  collection is biased toward directed graphs.  See
  ``alb-graph-theory.pdf`` for further information.

`alb-theorems.sty`
  Provides a minimal collection of theorem type environments.  See
  ``alb-theorems.pdf`` for further information.

`alb-algorithms.sty`
  Provides environments and commands for typesetting algorithms and
  floats containing algorithms, including commands to define identifiers
  for accessor functions and procedures.  See
  ``alb-algorithms.pdf`` for further information.

`alb-proofs.sty`
  Provides the `albProof` environment which implements Lamport's
  structured proofs described in the paper:

    Leslie Lamport, *How to Write a Proof*, 1993.

  See ``alb-proofs.pdf`` for further information.

`alb-avm.sty`
  Provides environments and commands to typeset typed feature structures
  and inequated typed feature structures in attribute-value matrix (AVM)
  notation.  See ``alb-avm.pdf`` for further information.

Emacs lisp modules
------------------

The collection of emacs lisp modules support the LaTeX style files and
classes by exenting AUCTeX and providing the following additional
capabilities.

- Generate file names from sentences
- Manipulate local variables lists
- Associate AUCTeX, and RefTeX with LaTeX source code
- Extend AUCTeX and RefTeX to ease the management of large projects
  including functions to create skeleton files from descriptive
  sentences, improve the lookup of filenames, and automate the use of
  labels.
- Extend AUCTeX to parse LaTeX via a simplified yet extensible parser
  with few additional restrictions on the form of LaTeX code.
