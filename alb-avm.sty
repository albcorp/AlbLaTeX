% "albAvm" environment.
%
% Attribute value matrix is entered via the supporting commands:
% "\albAvmTag{tag}{xxxsub}", "\albAvmRef{tag}", "\albAvmType{type}", and
% "\albAvmFeat{feat}{sub}".  In addition, inequations are supported by
% including a sequence of comma separated "\albAvmIneqtn{lhs}{rhs}"  
% commands as the last line in the environment.

\newenvironment{albAvm}[0]{%
  $\left[
    \begin{array}[c]{l}
  }{%
    \end{array}
  \right]$
  }


%
% "\albAvmTag{tag}{xxxsub}" command.
%
% Use where a substructure is required. "tag" is used to label the
% substructure and is subsequently used to refer to the substructure.
% "xxxsub" should be an explicit substructure, i.e., an "albAvmType" command
% followed by a possibly empty list of "albAvmFeat" commands.

\newcommand{\albAvmTag}[2]{%
  \mbox{\framebox{#1}\ } #2
  }


%
% "\albAvmRef{tag}" command.
%
% Use where a substructure is required. "tag" refers to a substructure
% previously defined with an "albAvmTag" command.

\newcommand{\albAvmRef}[1]{%
  \mbox{\framebox{#1}}
  }


%
% "\albAvmType{type}" and "\albAvmFeat{feat}{sub}" commands.
%
% Use where an substructure or explicit substructure is required. "type" is
% the type label for the substructure.  Each pair "{feat}{sub}" is a
% feature-value pair in the substructure.

\newcommand{\albAvmType}[1]{%
  \mbox{\textbf{#1}} \\
  }

\newcommand{\albAvmFeat}[2]{%
  \mbox{\textsc{#1}} : 
  \left[
    \begin{array}[c]{l}
      #2  
    \end{array}
  \right] \\
  }


%
% "\albAvmIneqtn{lhs}{rhs}" command.
%
% Use where an inequation is required.  "lhs" and "rhs" refer to substructures
% previously defined with "albAvmTag" commands.  Sequences of "albAvmIneqtn"
% commands should be separated by commas and may require the manual insertion
% of line breaks with "\\".

\newcommand{\albAvmIneqtn}[2]{%
  \mbox{\framebox{#1}} \not\leftrightarrow \mbox{\framebox{#2}}
